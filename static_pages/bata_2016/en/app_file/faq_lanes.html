Silicon Valley Express Lanes (sometimes referred to as High Occupancy Toll or “HOT” Lanes) will have no toll booths, and fees will be collected electronically using FasTrak. Tolls for solo drivers will vary based on the level of congestion and will be adjusted to maintain a free flow of service in the Express Lanes. All eligible carpool vehicles will have free access to the Express Lanes.

Carpools will continue to use the lanes for free while solo drivers will use the lanes for a fee that will vary depending on the level of congestion in the Express Lanes. The variable fee will make excess capacity available to paying motorists while guaranteeing a reasonable travel time for all users of the lanes.</p></dd></ds></ds>
