If your FasTrak account was established using a credit card, there is no deposit for the first three (3) toll tags, but for each toll tag over three, there is a $20 deposit. For cash/check accounts, there is a $20 deposit for each toll tag. All deposits are refunded when the account is closed and the toll tag is returned in good condition.</p></dd></ds><ds editareadesc="Toll Tag Not Working"><dt>What do I do if my toll tag is not working?</dt><dd><p>If the message on the Driver Feedback Display at the toll booth is blank, or if the toll tag does not beep as you drive through the toll plaza or toll gantry, there may be a problem with your toll tag or with your account.
