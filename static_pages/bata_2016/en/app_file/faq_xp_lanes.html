 What Are Express Lanes?
</dt>
<dd>
 <p>Express Lanes are specially-designated highway lanes that allow solo drivers to choose to pay a toll to use the lanes and that are free to carpools, motorcycles, vanpools and other eligible vehicles during the designated hours of operation. Outside of the hours of operation, the lanes are open to regular traffic.</p>
</dd></ds><ds><dt>
 What's the difference between an express lane and a high occupancy vehicle (HOV) lane?
</dt>
<dd>
 <p>To drive in HOV lanes, you must be in a carpool, vanpool, public transit vehicle, riding a motorcycle or other HOV-exempt vehicle during designated hours of operation. Outside the hours of operation, carpool lanes revert to general traffic use.</p>
 <p>With express lanes, the same general carpool principles apply, but other vehicles are given the choice to pay to use the lanes. This allows the unused capacity of an HOV lane to be utilized for a fee so that all lanes benefit from the additional freeway movement. For single occupany vehicles, the express lane acts as a toll road. In the Bay Area, tolls are collected electronically using a FasTraktoll tag.</p>

 What are the benefits of express lanes?
</dt>
<dd>
 <p>Express Lanes offer a new choice to highway drivers, utilize additional HOV lane capacity, encourage carpools and vanpools, and provide more reliable travel times.</p>
</dd></ds><ds><dt>
 How much does it cost to use an express lane?
</dt>
<dd>
 <p>Express lane tolls change depending on traffic conditions, increasing as traffic congestion increases and decreasing as traffic congestion decreases. Toll rates are set by the express lane operator. For example, the tolls for the SR-237 express lane ranges from $0.30 to $4.75.</p>
</dd></ds><ds><dt>
 What are the options to pay your toll in an express lane?
</dt>
<dd>
 <p>Express Lanes use FasTrak for the electronic collection of tolls. There are no tollbooths or traffic gates, customers do not need to slow down or stop to provide a toll payment. A valid FasTrak account and a properly mounted toll tag are required.</p>
</dd></ds><ds><dt>
 How does the express lane toll system work?
</dt>
<dd>
 <p>Tolls are collected electronically using a valid FasTrak tag. The toll system is fully electronic. Roadside equipment recognizes the FasTrak tag, records the transaction, and transmits the information to the FasTrak Customer Service Center to automatically deduct the toll from the account holder's pre-paid balance.</p> 
 <p>Overhead electronic pricing signs will display the toll rate to use the express lanes to specific destinations.</p> 
 <p>In open access express lane configurations, tolls from driving to successive destinations, each marked by an overhead electronic pricing sign displaying the toll rate, will be combined to form a single 'trip'.</p> 
 <p>Tolls will only be collected during the posted express lane hours of operation. Outside of the hours of operation, the overhead signage will display &quot;OPEN TO PUBLIC&quot; and any vehicle may use the lane toll free during these times.</p>
</dd></ds><ds><dt>
 Are there any express lanes open now in the Bay Area?
</dt>
<dt></dt>
<dd>
 <p>Yes. Currently, express lanes are open on the I-680 southbound over the Sunol Grade and the I-580 through Dublin, Pleasanton and Livermore. These express lanes are operated by the <a href="http://www.alamedactc.org/expresslanes" target="_blank">Alameda County Transportation Commission</a>. In the southern part of the Bay Area, there are express lanes on SR-237 which is operated by the <a href="http://www.vta.org/expresslanes" target="_blank">Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority</a>.</p>
</dd></ds><ds><dt>
 How do cars enter and exit the express lanes?
</dt>
<dd>
 <p>Express lanes will have either an open access or limited access lane configuration (or a mix of the two), depending on operational issues. For limited access, there are specific designated entry and exit points. For open access, drivers can freely enter and exit the express lanes where they choose just like today's HOV lanes in the Bay Area.</p> 
 <p>Currently, the SR-237 Express lanes use a limited access configuration, with one entry point and one exit point. The I-680 Sunol Express Lane is limited access as well, but has multiple locations to enter and exit the express lane. The I-580 Express Lanes have some limited access sections, but for the most part, use an open access configuration.</p>
</dd></ds><ds><dt>
 What are the hours of operation for the express lanes?
</dt>
<dd>
 <p>Hours of operation are posted on signage along express lanes. Hours of operations vary by express lane location and mirror HOV lane hours of operation.</p>
</dd></ds><ds><dt>

 Do I need a FasTrak toll tag if I'm a carpool, vanpool, motorcycle or other toll-exempt vehicle?

 <p>A FasTrak toll tag is not required. If you have a FasTrak toll tag, put it in the Mylar bag that it came with to avoid the roadside equipment from reading it and charging you a toll. It is important to make sure that after your toll-free trip, you properly re-install your toll tag onto your windshield. If you have a FasTrak Flex toll tag, set it in the proper 2 or 3+ position prior to starting your trip.</p> 
 <p><strong>I-580 Dublin/Pleasanton-Livermore</strong></p> 
 <p>A special FasTrak toll tag is required to qualify for toll-free travel.

Use the 2 position if there are 2 people in the vehicle. Use the 3+ position if there are 3 or more people in the vehicle. Vanpools, motorcycles and eligible clean air vehicles should also use the 3+ position.</p>

 What if I'm not from the Bay Area? How can I use the Bay Area Express Lanes?
</dt>
<dd>
 <p>Anyone with a mailing address in the United States is able to sign up for a FasTrak account. Purchase a toll tag at a local retail store location and activate it through the new account enrollment process. It is free to open and maintain a FasTrak account; you only pay for your tolls. A security deposit may be required for the tag, but it will be fully refunded to you when you return the toll tag to FasTrak. </p> 
 <p>Even for short visits to the Bay Area, signing up for a FasTrak account has its benefits. FasTrak allows you to use Express Lanes, qualify for carpool and bridge toll discounts, cross toll bridges without having to stop at the toll booth, and even pay for parking at the San Francisco International Airport (SFO). And, FasTrak is recognized statewide. Your FasTrak toll tag can be used anywhere you see the FasTrak logo displayed, including the toll roads in Southern California.</p>
