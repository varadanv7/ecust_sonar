Most of these FasTrak lanes are positioned in the far left lanes. Your toll tag will be read, recording your date and time of entry as you enter the parking lot and the gate will rise. A parking ticket will not be issued.</p><p>As you exit the lot, you will again drive through the lane identified by the FasTrak logo and your toll tag will be read again, recording your time of exit. Stop at the exit device and read the payment screen. You will be issued a parking receipt which MUST be taken to open the exit gate.</p><p>Your parking fee will automatically be calculated using entry and exit dates and times. If the fee is $10.00 or less it will be posted to your FasTrak account directly. Parking fees greater than $10.00 will be charged directly to your credit card on file with your FasTrak account. All transactions will be included on your FasTrak statement or can be viewed by logging into your account on the web. </p></dd></ds><ds editareadesc="Parking Program"><dt>What if I do not want to participate in the Parking Program?</dt><dd><p>If you are a credit card customer you will automatically be opted into the Parking Program. If you do not want to pay your airport parking with FasTrak, you can either 1) use a non-FasTrak lane when entering/exiting the lot, or 2) choose to opt-out of the parking program. To opt out, you will need to log into your FasTrak account on the web select "Parking" on the left hand side of your screen, then select "Opt out". You can also contact the FasTrak Customer Service Center by mail, fax, or phone to opt out. If you choose to opt back into the Parking Program at a later date, you must go through the same procedures.</p></dd></ds><ds editareadesc="Parking Charge"><dt>Will the parking charge be posted to my account?</dt><dd><p>Parking fees of $10.00 or less will be deducted from your FasTrak account's prepaid balance and will appear on your FasTrak statement as deductions.
