<ds editarea="ds1"><title>Toll Violations</title><ds editareadesc="faq_viol_gen_1"><dt>What are the penalties and late fees for a Notice of Toll Evasion?</dt><dd><p>It is a violation of the toll evasion statutes under California Vehicle Code Section 23302 et seq. and Streets and Highways Code Section 30843 if you fail to pay the established bridge toll. Pursuant to California Vehicle Code Section 40250 et seq., toll evasion violations shall be enforced by the issuance of notices of toll evasion, delinquent toll evasion and the imposition of civil penalties. The following is a schedule of toll evasion penalties:</p>
            <p><strong>First Notice Issued</strong></p>
            <p>Toll plus $25 penalty</p>
			<p><strong>Second Notice Issued</strong></p>
            <p>Toll plus $70 ($25 penalty plus $45 late fee).</p>
            <p>If toll is paid within 15 days, penalty is reduced to $25</p></dd></ds><ds editareadesc="faq_viol_gen_2"><dt>How do I pay my violation penalty?</dt><dd><p>A violation notice will be mailed to the vehicle's registered owner. Payment can be made online at <a href="http://www.bayareafastrak.org" target="_blank">www.bayareafastrak.org</a> or over the phone using a credit card, by mailing a check or money order to <a href="https://www.bayareafastrak.org/en/support/csc.shtml" target="_blank">Bay Area FasTrak</a>, or with cash at one of hundreds of local <a href="https://www.bayareafastrak.org/en/howitworks/cashLocationsMap.html" target="_blank">cash payment locations</a>. The walk in counter at the Customer Service Center takes all forms of payment as well.</p></dd></ds><ds editareadesc="faq_viol_gen_3"><dt>I am not a FasTrak account holder and I used the FasTrak toll lane without paying the toll. Will I receive a violation notice?</dt><dd><p>Yes. When you pass through a bridge toll lane without paying the toll or travel in the I-580 express lanes without a valid FasTrak tag, an image of your license plate is captured. If traveling on the Golden Gate Bridge, an invoice will be mailed to the vehicle's registered owner. For all other toll bridges, a violation notice is sent to the vehicle's registered owner within 21 days of the toll violation at the address on file with the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV), pursuant to the Streets and Highways Code Section 27174.1.</p>
            <p>The first notice requests payment for the toll amount and an additional $25 penalty. If you fail to respond to the instructions on the first notice, a second notice will be sent for the toll amount plus a $70 penalty ($25 penalty plus $45 late penalty). Failure to respond to the second notice will result in additional penalties and fees and referral of the amount due to a collections agency and/or the withholding of your vehicle registration by the DMV.</p>
            <p>You can resolve your violation <a href="https://www.bayareafastrak.org/en/howitworks/makeapayment.shtml" target="_blank">online</a> by paying the balance due using a credit card or you can submit a dispute. To pay your violation by check, please follow the instructions described on the violation notice. To pay your violation with cash, visit one of our <a href="https://www.bayareafastrak.org/en/howitworks/cashLocationsMap.html" target="_blank">cash payment locations</a> or the walk in counter at the Customer Service Center during normal hours of operation.</p></dd></ds><ds editareadesc="faq_viol_gen_4"><dt>I am not a FasTrak account holder. Why do I receive an invoice when I cross the Golden Gate Bridge without stopping, but a toll violation notice when I cross any of the other Bay Area toll bridges without stopping?</dt><dd><p>The Golden Gate Bridge converted to All Electronic Tolling (AET) and thus offers license plate tolling, a system that takes a picture of your license plate and mails you an invoice for the toll amount. The other Bay Area toll bridges do not offer license plate tolling. Therefore, if you do not have a FasTrak account, you must stop at the toll plaza and pay your tolls in cash. The best way to avoid violations is to sign up for a FasTrak account. FasTrak users also receive discounts on Golden Gate Bridge tolls.</p></dd></ds><ds editareadesc="faq_viol_gen_5"><dt>I am a FasTrak account holder, but I received a toll violation notice. What should I do?</dt><dd><p>If you opened your FasTrak account in the Bay Area and received a violation notice, you can resolve it either online by going to <a href="https://www.bayareafastrak.org/vector/violations/bataViolationInquiry.do?from=Home&locale=en_US" target="_blank">Violations</a>, or by mail by providing your FasTrak account number or toll tag number on the notice and submitting it to the address indicated on the notice. You should also update your account information to make sure all your vehicle information is registered correctly. Your toll amount will be charged to your account, and any penalties may be waived.</p>
			<p>If you opened your FasTrak account at a toll facility in Southern California (e.g., 91 Express Lanes, San Joaquin Hills, Foothill, and Eastern Toll Roads, Interstate 15, or South Bay Expressway) and received a violation notice from the Bay Area FasTrak Customer Service Center, you have 10 days from the date of the violation notice to contact the toll facility where you opened your account and provide your vehicle license plate number. After you have done so, the toll amount you owe will be automatically charged to your Southern California FasTrak account.</p></dd></ds><ds editareadesc="faq_viol_gen_6"><dt>I have a FasTrak toll tag, but I still received a violation notice in the mail. Why did this happen?</dt><dd><p>There are several reasons that could explain why you received a violation.</p>
			<ul>
            	<li>The battery in your FasTrak toll tag may not be working. If you don't hear a beep or see the light blink when the tag is read, you should contact the Customer Service Center to get your tag replaced. A Customer Service Representative may be able to waive the violation penalty as a first time courtesy.</li>
                <li>The license plate of your vehicle has not been listed in your account. Add the vehicle license plate and backdate the start date to ensure proper tolling. This will also automatically remove the violation penalty.</li>
                <li>Your FasTrak account balance may be negative. This may be due to the credit card on file having expired or the need to add funds to your cash or check based account. A Customer Service Representative can assist you with adding funds to your account and may be able to waive the violation penalty.</li>

Why did I receive a violation notice for my carpool trip?</dt><dd><p>In order for carpools and other eligible vehicles to travel in the I-580 Express Lanes toll-free, a FasTrak Flex tag set in the proper position (2 or 3+) and associated with a valid Fastrak account is required. You can order a FasTrak Flex tag online via the account enrollment process by <a href="https://www.bayareafastrak.org/en/signup/signup.shtml" target="_blank">clicking here</a>. To find a retail location near you to pick up a FasTrak Flex toll tag, visit the <a href="https://www.bayareafastrak.org/en/howitworks/wheretobuy.shtml" target="_blank">Where to Buy</a> page. We recommend that you call ahead to ensure that FasTrak Flex toll tags are in stock.</p></dd></ds><ds  editareadesc="faq_viol_gen_8"><dt>Is there anything I can do to avoid getting a violation notice if I did not pay the toll?</dt><dd><p>No. When a violation occurs, a violation payment notice is sent to the vehicle's registered owner using an automated process. The toll collectors at the toll bridges are unable to accept payment for the violation tolls because it is not possible for them to match the payment with the violation that is being processed.</p></dd></ds><ds editareadesc="faq_viol_gen_9"><dt>I received a letter from a collections agency (Law Enforcement Systems, Inc) regarding outstanding violations. I have a dispute or question about it. Who can I contact?</dt><dd><p>If you have a dispute or question about a letter you received from Law Enforcement Systems regarding outstanding violations, the FasTrak Customer Service Center is unable to assist you. Since your case was turned over to the collection agent, you will need to contact them to discuss your case further.</p>
