Can I drive in the designated HOV/carpool-only lane even if I am driving across the bridge by myself?</dt><dd><p>No.  Effective July 1, 2011, the <strong>YELLOW</strong> Clean Air Stickers issued by the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) have expired.  You are no longer able to drive in a High Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) or carpool lane (on the bridges or the Express Lanes) unless you meet the minimum passenger requirements for carpools.  Drivers caught using an HOV lane, without the required number of passengers, may be cited by law enforcement. </p></dd></ds><ds editareadesc="Pass24, PlatePass"><dt>What are Pass24<sup>&reg;</sup>, eToll<sup>&reg;</sup>, TollPass<sup>&reg;</sup>, and PlatePass<sup>&reg;</sup>?</dt><dd><p>Each of these four programs are electronic toll payment systems that enable certain rental car customers to use the FasTrak lanes on the Bay Area toll bridges. These allow you to drive non-stop through the toll plaza in any lane with a FasTrak sign. Upon renting a vehicle from a participating rental car agency, these individual services charge tolls plus a service fee as agreed upon in your rental agreement. Not all rental car agencies participate in either the Pass24<sup>&reg;</sup>, eToll<sup>&reg;</sup>, TollPass<sup>&reg;</sup>, and PlatePass<sup>&reg;</sup>programs. You may not use carpool lanes unless you have the required number of occupants.</p><p>For a list of participating rental car agencies and for more information about Pass24<sup>&reg;</sup>, go to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rentatoll.com">www.rentatoll.com</a> or call (877) 509-9506.</p><p>For a list of participating rental car agencies and for more information about either eToll<sup>&reg;</sup> or TollPass<sup>&reg;</sup><a target="_blank" href="http://www.htallc.com">www.htallc.com</a> or call (800) 482-0159.</p><p>For a list of participating rental car agencies and for more information about PlatePass<sup>&reg;</sup>, go to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.platepass.com">www.platepass.com</a> or call (877) 411-4300.</p></dd></ds></ds>
