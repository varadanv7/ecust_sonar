Will I receive a violation notice?</dt><dd><p>Yes. When you pass through a bridge toll lane without paying the toll, an image of your license plate is captured. If traveling on the Golden Gate Bridge, an invoice will be mailed to the vehicleâ€™s registered owner. For all other bridges, a violation notice is sent to the vehicle's registered owner within 21 days of the toll violation at the address on file with the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV), pursuant to the Streets and Highways Code Section 27174.1. The first notice requests payment for the toll amount and an additional $25 penalty. If you fail to respond to the instructions on the first notice, a second notice will be sent for the toll amount plus a $70 penalty ($25 penalty plus $45 late penalty). Failure to respond to the second notice will result in additional penalties and fees and referral of the amount due to a collections agency and/or the withholding of your vehicle registration by the DMV.</p><p>	  You can resolve your violation <a href="https://www.bayareafastrak.org/vector/dynamic/violations/index.shtml">online</a> by paying the balance due using a credit card, or you can submit a dispute. To pay your violation by check, please follow the instructions described on the violation notice.</p></dd></ds><ds editareadesc="Violation"><dt>I am not a FasTrak account holder. Why do I receive an invoice when I cross the Golden Gate Bridge without stopping, but a toll violation notice when I cross any of the other Bay Area bridges without stopping?</dt><dd><p>The Golden Gate Bridge converted to All Electronic Tolling (AET) and thus offers license plate tolling, a system that takes a picture of your license plate and mails you an invoice for the toll amount. The other Bay Area bridges do not offer license plate tolling.  Therefore, if you do not have a FasTrak account, you must stop at the toll plaza and pay your tolls in cash. The best way to avoid violations is to sign up for a FasTrak account. FasTrak users also receive discounts on Golden Gate Bridge tolls.</p></dd></ds><ds editareadesc="Violation"><dt>I am a FasTrak account holder, but I received a toll violation notice. What should I do?</dt><dd><p>If you opened your FasTrak account in the Bay Area and received a violation notice, you can resolve it either online by going to <a href="https://www.bayareafastrak.org/vector/dynamic/violations/index.shtml">Violations</a>, or by mail by providing your FasTrak account number or toll tag number on the notice and submitting it to the address indicated on the notice. You should also update your account information to make sure all your vehicle information is registered correctly. Your toll amount will be charged to your account, and any penalties may be waived.</p><p>If you opened your FasTrak account at a toll facility in Southern California (e.g., 91 Express Lanes, San Joaquin Hills, Foothill, and Eastern Toll Roads, Interstate 15, or South Bay Expressway) and received a violation notice from the Bay Area FasTrak Customer Service Center, you have 10 days from the date of the violation notice to contact the toll facility where you opened your account and provide your vehicle license plate number. After you have done so, the toll amount you owe will be automatically charged to your Southern California FasTrak account. </p></dd></ds></ds>
