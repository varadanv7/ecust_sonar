	<p editareadesc="Make a Payment">There are two ways to pay for a Golden Gate Bridge toll crossing if you are not a FasTrak account holder: Set up a One-Time Payment or Pay an Invoice after you receive one in the mail.<br/><br/>If you used a FasTrak facility that requires a valid FasTrak account, but did not have one at the time, or if you didn't pay your notice by the due date, you can pay for your tolls and any associated penalties using the Resolve a Violation button.<br/><br/>If you are a FasTrak account holder and received an invoice or violation, please do not make a payment at this time, but use the corresponding invoice or violation button below to file a dispute and let us know how we can resolve this issue for you. </p>
