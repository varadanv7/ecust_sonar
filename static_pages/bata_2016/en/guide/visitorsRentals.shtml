			<div class="tipsBlockTitle">Use your FasTrak account for a rental vehicle</div>
			It's convenient to pay tolls in any vehicle you are driving using your existing FasTrak account and toll tag. Log in to your account. Add the vehicle with its license plate number to your Registered Vehicle list. Set the dates to the period you are using the vehicle. Mount your toll tag in the vehicle. At the end of the period of use, remove your toll tag from the vehicle and delete the vehicle from your account.

		This bridge charges a toll when you cross southbound into San Francisco, but you cannot stop on the bridge to pay the toll. You must use other options to pay. The tolling process begins when a camera reads your vehicle license plate or when an antenna detects a toll tag. If you have a rental vehicle toll plan, it will pay this toll for you. Or, you can pay the toll directly using one of our payment options.
		<br><br>
		A One Time Payment is an easy option to pay this toll.

		<br>
		You can open a FasTrak account to pay tolls electronically and use all FasTrak travel options even during a short visit to the Bay Area.
		<br><br>
		With FasTrak, you avoid waiting in line to pay cash tolls at bridges. You automatically receive a $1 discount on each Golden Gate Bridge toll charged to your account. You can use all express lanes as a solo driver. 
		<br><br>
		To travel toll-free in the I-580 and I-680 Contra Costa express lanes as a carpool, motorcycle or eligible Clean Air Vehicle (CAV), get a FasTrak Flex toll tag instead of a standard FasTrak toll tag, at no additional cost.
