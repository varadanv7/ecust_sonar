    <p>No. The toll tag is on loan to you by the FasTrak Customer Service Center.</p> 
    <p>If a credit card is stored as the primary payment method on your FasTrak account, there is no security deposit for up to the first three (3) toll tags on your account. For each toll tag over three, there is a $20 deposit. If you do not have a credit card stored to your FasTrak account, there is a $20 deposit for each toll tag. All deposits are refunded when the account is closed and the toll tag is returned in good condition to the FasTrak Customer Service Center.</p>

    <p>A security deposit may be required when you open your FasTrak account.</p> 
    <p>For accounts that use a credit card as the primary payment method, a deposit will NOT be required for the first three (3) toll tags issued to your FasTrak account. If more than three toll tags are issued, you will be charged a deposit of $20 for each additional toll tag.</p> 
    <p>For accounts that use cash or checks as the primary payment method, a refundable deposit of $20 is required for each toll tag.</p> 
    <p>Note: Should you close your account and return your toll tag in good working condition, the deposit will be refunded to you. Deposits may be forfeited for damaged, lost or stolen toll tags.</p>

  <div id="switch" class="panel-collapse collapse collapsediv"> 
   <div id="faq_tag_003" class="panel-body"> 
    <p>Yes. The toll tag mounted to your windshield can be moved from vehicle to vehicle as long as it is properly mounted at each location, as described in the <a href="../howitworks/howToMount.shtml">Mounting Instructions</a>. It is recommended that the vehicle information, including license plate number, make, and model for each vehicle, be listed on your account. However, to avoid potential problems, we recommend that you obtain toll tags for each vehicle.</p> 
    <p>The potential problems that can occur when sharing a toll tag between several vehicles include, losing the toll tag, having the toll tag in the wrong car when you need it, or wearing out the Velcro strips much sooner than normal. In addition, your statement will not distinguish which car you were in when crossing the bridge or using the Express Lanes, and for some customers, this is important for tracking their toll transactions. If you want to track your toll transactions by vehicle, you need to obtain separate toll tags for separate vehicles.</p> 
    <p>You can request additional toll tags by logging into your account online and clicking on &quot;Tags &amp; Vehicles&quot;. You can also download and complete an <a href="../images/toll_tag_request_form.pdf" target="_blank">Additional Toll Tag Request Form</a> and send it to the Customer Service Center.</p>

   <div id="faq_tag_004" class="panel-body"> 
    <p>If the message on the Driver Feedback Display at the toll booth is blank or if the toll tag does not beep as you drive through the toll plaza or toll gantry, there may be a problem with your toll tag or with your account. If you notice these problems, contact the Customer Service Center for assistance.</p>

    <p>If the toll tag is lost, stolen or damaged, you will be liable for the deposit amount of $20. If it is lost/stolen and you immediately notify the FasTrak Customer Service Center, you will not be responsible for any unauthorized use of your toll tag after notification. If the toll tag is stolen and documentation is provided (e.g., police report), the deposit may be adjusted. If the toll tag is defective, return it to the FasTrak Customer Service Center and request a replacement at no additional cost.</p>

    <p>You can return your toll tag in person or by mail to the Customer Service Center. If you are returning the toll tag by mail, we recommend sending the toll tag by certified or registered mail.</p> 
    <p>Toll tags must be sent within 10 business days of the request for account closure.</p>

    <p>If you would like to replace a toll tag that is no longer working or would like to replace your toll tag with a different type, call the Customer Service Center at 1-877-BAY-TOLL (1-877-229-8655) and speak to a customer service representative. Tell them that you would like to replace a toll tag. Provide the toll tag number of the toll tag you are replacing and specify which type of toll tag you would like in exchange. Your new toll tag will arrive in the mail. An envelope with pre-paid postage will be included for you to use to return your old toll tag.</p> 
    <p>Please note: Toll tag security deposits apply to all toll tags, including replacement toll tags. When the toll tag you are returning is received by the Customer Service Center, your security deposit balance will be adjusted accordingly.</p>
