<dt id="faq_acc_601">I received a notice that my prepaid balance is low or negative, but couldn’t access my account to add funds. Will I be charged late fees for my toll activity?</dt>
<dd>
	<p>Fees are not immediately charged to your account when your account has a negative balance. When the system upgrade is completed, we recommend that you make a payment online within ten (10) days to keep your account in good standing and to avoid receiving violation notices.</p>

<dt id="faq_acc_602">I used a vehicle that wasn’t listed on my account during the closure. What should I do?</dt>
<dd>
	<p>Add the vehicle to your account and backdate the vehicle’s start date to include the dates of any toll crossings that occurred in that vehicle during the closure.</p>
	<p>If you used your FasTrak tag, we still recommend adding the vehicle to your account. If for some reason the roadside equipment wasn’t able to read your tag properly and a violation notice is generated, adding the vehicle to your account and backdating the start date will waive the fees automatically. You will only be liable for the tolls incurred during the backdated time period.</p>
