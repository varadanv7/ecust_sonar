<dd>
	<p><strong>If you are a FasTrak or License Plate account holder</strong>, your tolls will be collected from your account as usual.</p>
	<p><strong>If you are not an account holder</strong>, an invoice will be created after you cross the bridge and will be mailed to the vehicle’s registered owner. You can wait for the invoice in the mail and pay your toll at that time.</p>
	<p><strong>If you already have a one-time payment (OTP)</strong> set up and have included the dates of the system upgrade in your vehicle’s effective period, your tolls will be charged to your credit card or applied to your pre-paid balance as normal.</p>
	<p><strong>If you are in a rental car</strong> and want to pay your own tolls, we recommend that you set up a One-Time Payment (OTP). If you crossed the Golden Gate Bridge on October 31<sup>st</sup>, November 1<sup>st</sup>, November 2<sup>nd</sup>, or November 3<sup>rd</sup>, you will have until Friday, November 7<sup>th</sup> to create a OTP and backdate the start date to include the date of the first toll crossing.</p>
