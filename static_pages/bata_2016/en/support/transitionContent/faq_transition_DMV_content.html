	<p>If you have a dispute or question about a letter you received from Law Enforcement Systems regarding outstanding violations, the FasTrak Customer Service Center is not able to assist you.

<dd>
	<p>If there is a DMV hold on your vehicle registration, DMV can take your payment to release the hold. You do not need to wait for the Customer Service Center to re-open to be able to resolve this issue. Any disputes over amounts due can be resolved once the system upgrade is completed and a refund can be sent to you if it is warranted.</p>
