<dd>
	<p>You can mail in a completed account application to start the new account process. The application will include your tag order. For in-person assistance, to open a new account online or to order an additional tag for an existing account, you will need to wait until the system upgrade has been completed.</p>
	<p>You may also purchase a new tag at a retail store and start using it right away, but you will need to register it to your account once the system is back online and cover any tolls incurred to keep your account in good standing.</p>
