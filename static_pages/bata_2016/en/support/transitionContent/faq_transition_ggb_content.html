<dd>
	<p>If you are a FasTrak or License Plate account holder, your tolls will be collected from your account as usual.</p>
	<p>If you are not an account holder, an invoice will be created after you cross the bridge and will be mailed to the vehicle's registered owner. You can wait for the invoice in the mail and pay your toll at that time.</p>
	<p>If you already have a one-time payment (OTP) set up and have included the dates of the system upgrade in your vehicle's effective period, your tolls will be charged to your credit card or applied to your pre-paid balance as normal.</p>
	<p>If you are in a rental car and want to pay your own tolls, we recommend that you open a One-Time Payment (OTP) account after 8:30am Tuesday, November 4<sup>th</sup>. If you crossed the Golden Gate Bridge on October 31<sup>st</sup>, November 1<sup>st</sup>, November 2<sup>nd</sup>, or November 3<sup>rd</sup>, an extension has been provided for you to set up an OTP after the system upgrade has been completed. You will have until Friday, November 7<sup>th</sup>, to create the OTP and backdate the start date to include the date of the first toll crossing.</p>

<dd>
	<p>If you used a credit card and the dates of the system upgrade are included in the defined time period, the tolls will be charged to your credit card after the system upgrade is completed. If you pre-paid tolls for a set number of crossings, the tolls will post when the system upgrade is completed.</p>

<dt id="faq_gen_605">I have a License Plate account and use check or cash to replenish my pre-paid balance. Will I be able to continue to cross the Golden Gate Bridge if my account balance becomes negative during the system upgrade?</dt>
<dd>
	<p>Yes, continue to use your License Plate account as you normally would. Fees are not immediately charged to your account when your account has a negative balance. When the system upgrade is completed, we recommend that you make a payment within ten (10) days to keep your account in good standing.</p>
