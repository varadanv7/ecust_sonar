		<p>
			No. Effective July 1, 2011, the <strong>YELLOW</strong> Clean Air
			Stickers issued by the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) have
			expired. You are no longer able to drive in a High Occupancy Vehicle
			(HOV) or carpool lane (on the toll bridges or the Express Lanes)
			unless you meet the minimum passenger requirements for carpools.
			Drivers caught using an HOV lane, without the required number of
			passengers, may be cited by law enforcement.

			<strong>State-Owned Bridges:</strong>
		</p>
		<p>
			Yes. Qualified single-occupancy clean air vehicles are permitted to
			use dedicated HOV/carpool lanes in the Bay Area during designated
			carpool hours, if these vehicles are displaying the distinctive
			WHITE, &nbsp;GREEN, or RED decals issued by the DMV. For more
			information, click <a

				target="_blank">here</a>.
		</p>
		<p>The expiration date for the WHITE, GREEN, or RED decals is
			January 1, 2019. As with all other carpool vehicles, single-occupancy
			clean air vehicles must also pay tolls when driving across the Bay
			Area toll bridges in an HOV/carpool lane.</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Golden Gate Bridge:</strong>
		</p>
		<p>The Golden Gate Bridge does not have dedicated HOV roadway
			lanes. However, there is a specific lane(s) dedicated for carpool use
			during carpool hours. Only vehicles that bear a DMV-issued WHITE
			Clean Air Vehicle decal are eligible for the $4 discounted toll rate
			for as long as California Vehicle Code Sections 5205.5 and 21655.9
			remain in effect. The expiration date for the WHITE decals is January
			1, 2019.</p>
		<p>
			Vehicles bearing the GREEN Clean Air Vehicle are <strong>NOT</strong>
			eligible for the reduced toll. You are not able to drive in a High
			Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) or carpool lane unless you meet the minimum
			passenger requirements for carpools. Drivers caught using an HOV
			lane, without the required number of passengers, may be cited by law
			enforcement.

		<p>Yes. Even if you have the required number of occupants in your

			3, depending on the carpool policies of the bridge you are crossing),
			you must still pay toll. However, like all other high-occupancy
