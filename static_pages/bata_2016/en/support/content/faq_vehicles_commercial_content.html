<dt id="faq_veh_301">What is an externally-mounted (or exterior) toll tag?</dt>
<dd>
	<p>An externally-mounted (or exterior) toll tag is designed to be screw-mounted on the front bumper, where the license plate would normal be located. It is installed using special tools and tamper-resistant screws to prevent loss or theft. For more information, click <a href="../support/mounting.shtml">here</a>.</p>

<dt id="faq_veh_302">What are the advantages of using FasTrak for my business?</dt>
<dd>
	<p>Your drivers don't need to have cash on hand; they don't have to stop at the toll booth - they only need to slow down; and they will be able to travel across the toll bridges faster. In addition, all their bridge crossings and toll payments are tracked by FasTrak and conveniently summarized on either a monthly or quarterly statement. This information is also available online anytime. </p>

<dt id="faq_veh_303">Is there a charge for the toll tags?</dt>
<dd>
	<p>There is no charge for the toll tag and no service charge to open and maintain a FasTrak account. To authorize automatic replenishments, establish an account using a credit card, which will require an initial prepaid balance of $25 per toll tag, plus a $20 per toll tag deposit for any toll tags over three (3). To establish an account using cash or checks as the primary payment method, an initial prepaid balance of $50 per toll tag, plus a $20 per toll tag deposit, is due at the time the account is opened.</p>

<dd>
	<p>No. FasTrak does not send out monthly bills/invoices. FasTrak is a prepaid toll collection system by which all toll usage is paid in advance.</p>

<dt id="faq_veh_306">Do my drivers still need to stop in the toll lanes?</dt>
<dd>
	<p>No, but they do need to slow to the posted speed limit for safety reasons and to allow the toll tag to be read.</p>

<dt id="faq_veh_307">Are there specific lanes my drivers must use?</dt>
<dd>
	<p>All toll booths on all eight toll bridges in the Bay Area accept FasTrak. All of the seven state-owned toll bridges have at least one FasTrak-only lane in operation. Cash is no longer accepted at the Golden Gate Bridge toll plaza, but all lanes accept FasTrak.</p>
	<p><strong>Note : Oversized vehicles must use specific lanes designated for oversized vehicles only per the California Vehicle Code.</strong></p>

<dt id="faq_veh_308">Do I need to have a toll tag for each vehicle in my fleet?</dt>
<dd>
	<p>All vehicles using FasTrak as a form of toll payment must have a toll tag mounted properly. It is recommended that each vehicle traveling across any Bay Area bridge on a regular basis be equipped with its own toll tag. However, since internal toll tags are mounted using only Velcro strips, they can be moved from vehicle to vehicle to better accommodate the vehicles in your fleet that only travel across toll bridges occasionally.</p>
