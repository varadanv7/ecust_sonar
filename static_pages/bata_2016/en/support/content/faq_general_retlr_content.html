<dt id="faq_gen_601">Where can I find a retail store that sells FasTrak tags?</dt>
<dd>
	<p>FasTrak tags can be found at Costco, Safeway and Walgreen retail stores. For a list of retail store locations selling FasTrak, please visit the <a href="../howitworks/wheretobuy.shtml">Where to Buy page</a>. We recommend calling the retail store ahead of your visit to ensure they have toll tags in stock.</p>

<dt id="faq_gen_602">Can I use my retail toll tag immediately after leaving the store?</dt>
<dd>
	<p>Yes. Of your total purchase price, $20 is held as a temporary deposit and the remaining balance is available for use immediately to pay for tolls. You will need to open an account with the tag or add it to an existing account or else it will be inactivated shortly after its first use.</p>

<dt id="faq_gen_603">How long do I have to sign up for a new account or to add the retail toll tag to my existing account?</dt>
<dd>
	<p>While a small balance is available for immediate use once you purchase a retail toll tag, we recommend that you complete the enrollment process for a new account or to add the toll tag to an existing account immediately after purchase. Otherwise, you will have seven (7) business days from its first use to complete the enrollment process or to add the toll tag to your existing account or else the toll tag will become "inactive" and in violation of California Vehicle Code 4770 and any other applicable law. </p>

<dt id="faq_gen_604">I thought FasTrak was a free service. What am I paying for when I purchase a tag from a retail store? </dt>
<dd>
	<p>The purchase price you pay at a retail store is used as a temporary deposit until you go through the registration process and open an account. There are no fees to lease a tag, but depending on the account type, a refundable security deposit may be necessary. </p>
	<p>If you register your tag and enroll in FasTrak using a credit card, the full purchase price and any promotional tolls from the retail store will be applied to your account balance and no security deposit will be required. (But if you fail to return the tag at account closure, your credit card will be charged $20 as the security deposit.)</p>
	<p>If you register your tag and enroll in FasTrak using cash or a check, $20 from the purchase price will be used as the tag security deposit and the rest of your purchase price will be applied to your pre-paid toll account balance, along with any promotional tolls. When you return your tag at account closure, your security deposit will be refunded to you.</p>

<dt id="faq_gen_605">When I purchased my toll tag from a retail store, there was a promotion advertised for free tolls. How do I get my free tolls?</dt>
<dd>
	<p>The promotion is for new accounts only. Upon opening up a <strong>new</strong> FasTrak account and registering your toll tag online or by phone, the free tolls will be credited to your prepaid toll balance. <strong>Offer limited to one per new account.</strong> This offer is not valid for existing FasTrak accounts.</p>

<dt id="faq_gen_606">Can I purchase a toll tag from a retail store and use it for my hybrid vehicle?</dt>
<dd>
	<p>Yes. Eligible clean air vehicles may use the FasTrak carpool lanes on toll bridges and qualify for the discounted toll rate with a valid FasTrak tag. Eligible clean air vehicles do not require a FasTrak tag to use the Express Lane network.</p>

<div class="faqs" editarea="Edit Information">
<dt id="faq_gen_607">Can I purchase more than one toll tag from a retail store, but only open one new FasTrak account?</dt>
<dd>
	<p>Yes. You can have one FasTrak account with multiple toll tags. All you need to do is to enroll in a new account using one of the retail toll tags. At the completion of the enrollment process, print out the confirmation page that identifies your new FasTrak account number. You will need it for the next step. Using the Add a Tag to An Existing Account function, add the other retail tags to your account.</p>
	<p><strong>It is important to note that any promotional offer for free tolls is valid only for new accounts, limited to one offer per new account. Therefore, when you register a toll tag to an existing account, that toll tag is not eligible for the promotional free tolls.</strong></p>

<dt id="faq_gen_608">How do I return a toll tag that I purchased from a retail store?</dt>
<dd>
	<p>All toll tags must be returned to the FasTrak Customer Service Center. Even a brand new toll tag in its original packaging must be returned to the FasTrak Customer Service Center, not to the retail store where it was purchased. If you have not completed the enrollment process with the toll tag or added it to an existing account yet, you must do so before you can return it. This step is necessary so that we know who and where to send any refund amount to. Or, you can return the tag in person at the walk in counter of the Customer Service Center.</p>
	<p>To complete the enrollment process, click <a href="../routers/tagreg.html">here</a>. Then request to closure your account by completing and submitting an <a href="../images/account_closure.pdf" target="_blank">Account Closure Form</a> along with your retail toll tag, in person or by mail, to the <a href="../support/csc.shtml">Customer Service Center</a>. If you are returning the toll tag by mail, we recommend sending the toll tag by certified or registered mail.</p>

<dt id="faq_gen_609">I accidentally threw away/lost/misplaced my Velcro strips, which had the validation code printed on them. Can I still register my retail toll tag without the validation code?</dt>
<dd>
	<p>Yes. You can contact the FasTrak <a href="../support/csc.shtml">Customer Service Center</a> and provide the toll tag number. They will be able to give you the validation code. They can also assist you with the account enrollment process or with adding the toll tag to your existing account over the phone.</p>
