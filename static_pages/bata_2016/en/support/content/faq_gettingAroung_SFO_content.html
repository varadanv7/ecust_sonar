<dt id="faq_arnd_301">How do I use FasTrak to pay for parking at SFO?</dt>
<dd>
	<p>As you enter the parking lot, use the lane that displays the FasTrak logo. Most of these FasTrak lanes are positioned in the far left lanes. Your toll tag will be read, recording your date and time of entry as you enter the parking lot and the gate will rise. A parking ticket will not be issued.</p>
	<p>As you exit the lot, you will again drive through the lane identified by the FasTrak logo and your toll tag will be read again, recording your time of exit. Stop at the exit device and read the payment screen. You will be issued a parking receipt which MUST be taken to open the exit gate.</p>
	<p>Your parking fee will automatically be calculated using entry and exit dates and times. If the fee is $10.00 or less, it will be deducted from your prepaid account balance. Parking fees greater than $10.00 will be charged directly to the primary credit card stored to your FasTrak account. All transactions will be included on your FasTrak statement or can be viewed by logging into your account on the web.</p>

<dt id="faq_arnd_302">How do I know if I can participate in the Parking Program?</dt>
<dd>
	<p>Participation in the Parking Program requires a credit card stored as your primary payment method on your FasTrak account. If you do have a credit card stored to your account, it is likely that you were opted in to the Parking Program during the account enrollment process. To check your participation status, sign in to your account online and look at your Account Settings. There is a checkbox for the Parking Program that you can select to participate or unselect to opt out. You can change your participation level at any time. You can also contact the Customer Service Center for assistance.</p>
	<p>If you do not have a credit card stored to your FasTrak account, you are not able to participate in the Parking Program. Please note that License Plate account holders also cannot participate in the Parking Program.</p>

<dt id="faq_arnd_303">What if I do not want to participate in the Parking Program?</dt>
<dd>
	<p>If you do not want to pay your airport parking with FasTrak, you can either 1) use a non-FasTrak lane when entering/exiting the lot, or 2) choose to opt-out of the parking program. To opt out, you can unselect participation in the Parking Program under your Account Settings or contact the FasTrak Customer Service Center for assistance.</p>

<dt id="faq_arnd_304">Why do I need to a credit card stored as my primary payment method to use FasTrak to pay for parking?</dt>
<dd>
	<p>FasTrak is a convenient way to electronically pay for your parking and not have to wait in line at the parking pay booth. Parking fees above $10.00 are charged directly to the credit card listed on your FasTrak account, not deducted from your prepaid account balance. This is so that your parking costs will not likely affect the calculation of your monthly average toll activity or replenishment amount.</p>

<div class="faqs" editarea="Edit Information">
<dt id="faq_arnd_305">Will the parking charge be posted to my account?</dt>
<dd>
	<p>Parking fees of $10.00 or less will be deducted from your FasTrak account's prepaid balance and will appear on your FasTrak statement as deductions. Parking fees greater than $10.00 will be charged directly to the credit card registered on your FasTrak account. A list of these charges will appear on the web under Transactions or on your statement under "FasTrak Parking".</p>

<dd>
	<p>No. There are no fees to use FasTrak to pay for parking. It's simple. Just use your toll tag upon entry and exit, and the parking charges will either be deducted from your FasTrak account or charged directly to your credit card, depending on the parking amount due.</p>

<dt id="faq_arnd_308">I was unable to use FasTrak to pay for parking. Why?/dt>
<dd>
	<p><u>The following list of reasons will cause ineligibility for parking at SFO:</u></p>
	<p>Cash or check account replenishment method</p>
	<ul class="bodyCopy">
	<li>To use FasTrak to pay for parking at SFO, you must use a credit card as your FasTrak replenishment method. If you use cash/check as your replenishment method, you cannot use FasTrak to pay for parking.</li></ul>
	<p>Opt Out was selected</p>
	<ul class="bodyCopy"><li>If you chose to opt out of the Parking Program, you cannot use FasTrak to pay for parking at SFO.</li></ul>
	<p>Toll tag did not read at entrance/exit</p>
	<ul class="bodyCopy"><li>A valid toll tag is needed upon entering or exiting the parking lot in order to use FasTrak to pay for your parking. If your toll tag did not beep or the gate did not open, you will not be able to use FasTrak to pay for parking. You should contact the FasTrak Customer Service Center to determine if a replacement toll tag is needed or if your FasTrak account needs attention.</li></ul>
	<p>Negative Account Balance</p>
   <ul class="bodyCopy"><li>If your account had a negative balance at the time you tried to enter or exit the parking lot, you will not be able to pay for parking using FasTrak.</li></ul>

<dt id="faq_arnd_310">My toll tag beeps when I drive through a parking lot at the Sacramento International Airport and Oakland International Airport. Can I pay for my parking there as well?</dt>
<dd>
	<p>No. The Sacramento and Oakland International Airports do not participate in the Bay Area FasTrak Parking Program. There may be equipment at these airports which will cause your toll tag to beep, but no information is retained or billed to your FasTrak account. </p>
