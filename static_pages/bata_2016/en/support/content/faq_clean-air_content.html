		<p>No. Effective July 1, 2011, the YELLOW Clean Air Stickers
			issued by the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) have expired. You
			are no longer able to drive in a High Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) or
			carpool lane (on the toll bridges or the Express Lanes) unless you
			meet the minimum passenger requirements for carpools. Drivers caught
			using an HOV lane, without the required number of passengers, may be

	<dt id="faq_cleanair_13002">I have a qualifying clean air vehicle

		<p>
			<strong>State-Owned Toll Bridges</strong>
		</p>
		<p>
			Yes. Qualified single-occupancy clean air vehicles are permitted to
			use dedicated HOV/carpool lanes in the Bay Area during designated
			carpool hours, if these vehicles are displaying the distinctive WHITE
			or GREEN decals issued by the DMV. Vehicles that meet the
			requirements for the WHITE decals are Inherently Low Emission
			Vehicles (ILEVs) that are typically certified pure zero emission
			vehicles (PZEV) (100% battery electric and hydrogen fuel cell) and
			compressed natural gas (CNG) vehicles. Vehicles that meet the
			requirements for the GREEN decals generally meet the enhanced
			Advanced Technology Partial Zero Emission Vehicle (AT PZEV)
			requirements, which include plug-in hybrid (PHEV) and hydrogen
			internal combustion engine (hydrogen ICE) vehicles. For more
			information, <a

				target="_blank">click here</a>.
		</p>
		<p>The expiration date for the WHITE or GREEN decals is January 1,
			2019. As with all other carpool vehicles, single-occupancy clean air
			vehicles must also pay tolls when driving across the Bay Area toll
			bridges in an HOV/carpool lane.</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Golden Gate Bridge</strong>
		</p>
		<p>The Golden Gate Bridge does not have dedicated HOV roadway
			lanes. However, there is a specific lane(s) dedicated for carpool use
			during carpool hours. Only vehicles that bear a DMV-issued WHITE
			Clean Air Vehicle decal are eligible for the $5.00 discounted toll
			rate for as long as California Vehicle Code Sections 5205.5 and
			21655.9 remain in effect. The expiration date for the WHITE decals is
			January 1, 2019.</p>
		<p>Vehicles bearing the GREEN Clean Air Vehicle are NOT eligible
			for the reduced toll. You are not able to drive in a High Occupancy
			Vehicle (HOV) or carpool lane unless you meet the minimum passenger
			requirements for carpools. Drivers caught using an HOV lane, without
			the required number of passengers, may be cited by law enforcement.</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Express Lanes</strong>
		</p>
		<p>Yes. Qualified single-occupancy clean air vehicles are
			permitted to use dedicated HOV/carpool lanes in the Bay Area during
			designated carpool hours, if these vehicles are displaying the
			distinctive WHITE or GREEN decals issued by the DMV.</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Please Note:</strong> In the I-580 Express Lanes, a FasTrak
			Flex tag set in the 3+ position is required to travel toll-free.

		<p>Yes. Even if you have the required number of occupants in your
			clean air vehicle to qualify as a carpool vehicle (i.e., either 2 or
			3, depending on the carpool policies of the bridge you are crossing),
			you must still pay the toll. However, like all other high-occupancy
