FasTrak will also allow solo drivers to pay to use the future Bay Area Express Lanes. The system has three components: a toll tag, which is placed inside your vehicle; an overhead antenna in the toll plaza, which reads the toll tag and automatically deducts the appropriate toll from your prepaid account; and video cameras to identify toll evaders.</p><p><strong>Note: Specific </strong><a target="_blank" href="https://www.bayareafastrak.org/vector/static/forms/docs/Vehicles_with_Metal_Oxide_Windshields.pdf">vehicle models</a> may require an externally-mounted toll tag (also referred to as an exterior toll tag).
