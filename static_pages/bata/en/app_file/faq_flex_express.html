<ds editarea="ds1"><title>FasTrak Flex and the I-580 Express Lanes</title><ds editareadesc="faq_tt_fxi_1"><dt>What is a FasTrak Flex toll tag?</dt><dd><p>Carpools, vanpools, motorcycles and other toll-exempt vehicles will need a FasTrak Flex toll tag to drive toll-free in the new I-580 Express Lanes, opening early next year. FasTrak Flex toll tags work just like a regular FasTrak toll tag at all other FasTrak toll facilities, including the eight Bay Area toll bridges and the parking garages at the San Francisco International Airport.</p></dd></ds><ds editareadesc="faq_tt_fxi_2"><dt>I already have a FasTrak toll tag. Do I also need a FasTrak Flex toll tag?</dt><dd><p>You only need to get the FasTrak Flex toll tag if you are a carpool, vanpool, motorcycle or other toll-exempt vehicle that will use the I-580 Express Lanes. Otherwise, your standard tag will work on the new I-580 Express Lanes as well as all other FasTrak facilities.</p></dd></ds><ds  editareadesc="faq_tt_fxi_3"><dt>What are the switch positions on a FasTrak Flex toll tag for?</dt><dd><p>The switch positions are used to tell the toll system the number of occupants in the vehicle so that the correct toll amount is collected and to assist with CHP enforcement of express lane use. Remember to set the switch prior to starting your trip.</p>
            <p><strong>In the I-580, SR-237, and I-680 Sunol express lanes</strong></p>
            <p>When set in the "1" position, the toll system will deduct the full toll amount from your account. When set in "2" or "3+", no toll will be deducted from your account, but the system will record your trip and will highlight your toll-free status to CHP for proper enforcement of the express lanes.</p>
            <p><strong>At toll bridges and parking garages</strong></p>
            <p>Regardless of which position the toll tag is switched to, the system will deduct the full toll from your account. At toll bridges, you must continue to use the designated carpool lanes to received discounted carpool rates.</p></dd></ds><ds editareadesc="faq_tt_fxi_4"><dt>How much does it cost to get a FasTrak Flex toll tag?</dt><dd><p>Standard FasTrak toll tags and the FasTrak Flex toll tags are treated the same way – free! There are no fees to open or to maintain a FasTrak account, regardless of the type of toll tag you use. As toll tags are leased, refundable security deposits do apply. The security deposit is $20 per toll tag. The deposit is refunded to you when you close your account and return the toll tag in good condition. If you maintain a valid credit card on your account, the security deposit for up to three toll tags is waived.</p>
            <p>FasTrak is not a "pay as you go" system. You deposit money into your FasTrak account and each time you use your tag, the toll amount is deducted from your account balance. An initial balance is required upon account opening so that you have a prepaid balance from which tolls can be deducted.</p>
            <p>To open an account using a valid credit card, an initial prepaid balance of $25 per toll tag is collected. To open an account using cash or a check deposit, an initial prepaid balance of $50 per toll tag plus a $20 per toll tag deposit is collected. The deposit is refunded to you when you close your account and return the toll tag in good condition. Any remaining balance on your account will also be refunded to you upon account closure.</p></dd></ds><ds editareadesc="faq_tt_fxi_5"><dt>How can I get a FasTrak Flex toll tag?</dt><dd><p>FasTrak Flex toll tags are available from the FasTrak Customer Service Center.

Carpools and other toll-exempt vehicles do not require a FasTrak Flex toll tag to receive toll-free travel in these express lanes. If you have a standard FasTrak toll tag in your vehicle, it must be placed in your Mylar bag before travel to avoid toll charges. If you have a FasTrak Flex toll tag in your vehicle, be sure it is set to the proper setting when traveling on the SR-237 or the I-680 Sunol express lanes.</p></dd></ds><ds  editareadesc="faq_tt_fxi_8"><dt>Do I need a FasTrak Flex toll tag to get the carpool discount on toll bridges?</dt><dd><p>To receive carpool discounts at toll bridges, you are required to use the designated carpool lane with a valid FasTrak toll tag – either a standard FasTrak toll tag or a FasTrak Flex toll tag will work.</p></dd></ds></ds>
