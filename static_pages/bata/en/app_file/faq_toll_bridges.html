			<ul>
            	<li>If your FasTrak account is valid and has a sufficient balance, it will display "VALID" or "VALID FASTRAK".</li>
                <li>If your FasTrak account has a low balance, it will display "LOW BAL" or "ACCOUNT LOW".</li>
				<li>If your FasTrak account is invalid, for any reason, the display will be blank or it will display "CALL FASTRAK".</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Note: There are no Driver Feedback Displays in the FasTrak lanes at the Benicia-Martinez Bridge, nor are there any in the Bay Area Express Lanes.</p></dd></ds><ds editareadesc="faq_gen_tb_4"><dt>I drive an oversized commercial truck. Are there specific lanes I must use even if I have a valid FasTrak toll tag?</dt><dd><p>Oversized vehicles must use specific lanes designated for oversized vehicles as specified by the California Vehicle Code.</p></dd></ds><ds editareadesc="faq_gen_tb_5"><dt>Which Bay Area toll bridges have FasTrak-only lanes?</dt><dd><p>FasTrak-only lanes are not staffed by toll collectors so that FasTrak users are able to drive through the toll plaza without having to stop.</p>
            <p>All of the seven state-owned toll bridges have at least one FasTrak-only lane in operation. At the Golden Gate Bridge, the lanes are all electronic, which means there are no toll collectors. FasTrak can be used in all the lanes at the Golden Gate Bridge without having to stop at the toll plaza.</p>

For toll lanes that are shared with FasTrak and cash paying motorists, FasTrak users should proceed with extreme caution, being alert for stopped vehicles and toll collectors. For Bay Area toll bridges with Open Road Tolling lanes (e.g., Benicia-Martinez Bridge), the posted speed limit is 55 miles per hour.</p></dd></ds><ds  editareadesc="faq_gen_tb_7"><dt>If I am in an eligible carpool vehicle and travel through a carpool lane with my toll tag, will I be charged on my FasTrak account?</dt><dd><p><strong>Golden Gate Bridge</strong></p>
            <p>Yes. To be eligible to receive the discounted carpool toll rate of $4.25 at the Golden Gate Bridge, you must have a FasTrak account in good standing and travel through a designated carpool lane. Eligible carpool vehicles include: (1) 2-axle vehicles with 3 or more people; (2) motorcycles, including three-wheeled motorcycles; and (3) buses. Two-seat vehicles and vehicles with rear axle dual tires do not qualify as a carpool on the Golden Gate Bridge. Carpool hours are 5 am to 9 am and 4 pm to 6 pm, weekdays except on specific observed holidays: New Year's Day, Presidents' Day (third Monday in Feb.), Memorial Day (last Monday in May), Independence Day (July 4), Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day.</p>
            <p>If a valid FasTrak toll tag is not present in the vehicle, the discounted toll rate will not apply, no matter whether or not the other carpool discount requirements are met.</p>
            <p><strong>All Other Toll Bridges</strong></p>
            <p>As of July 1, 2010, carpools are charged a discounted toll rate of $2.50. Carpools must use designated carpool lanes and pay the toll with FasTrak to qualify for the discounted toll rate. If you drive through a carpool toll lane without a FasTrak toll tag (even if you meet occupancy requirements for the carpool lane), a violation notice will be sent to the vehicle's registered owner. It is a violation of the toll evasion statutes under California Vehicle Code Section 23302 et seq. and Streets and Highways Code Section 30843 to fail to pay the established bridge toll.</p></dd></ds><ds editareadesc="faq_gen_tb_8"><dt>How can I pay a Golden Gate Bridge toll?</dt><dd><p>The Golden Gate Bridge is the first toll facility in the Bay Area to convert to All Electronic Tolling.
