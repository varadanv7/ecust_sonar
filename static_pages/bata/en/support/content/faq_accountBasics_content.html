<dt id="faq_acctbasics_8004">How is the prepaid balance in my account replenished?</dt>
<dd>
	<p>Account replenishment is different depending on the type of replenishment method you chose at the time you opened your account.</p>
	<p>For accounts that use a credit card as the primary payment method, automatic charges will be made to your credit card to replenish your FasTrak account whenever your prepaid toll balance falls below $15 or the minimum threshold.</p>
	<p>For accounts that use cash or checks as the primary payment method, you are responsible for depositing prepaid tolls into your FasTrak account whenever the "Low Bal" or "Account Low" message appears on the Driver Feedback Display located at the toll booth. You must replenish your account whenever your prepaid toll balance falls below $30 or the minimum threshold.</p>
</dd>
</div>

<div class="faqs">
<dt id="faq_acctbasics_8005">How is the replenishment amount determined?</dt>
<dd>
	<p>For accounts that use a credit card as the primary payment method, the amount charged to your credit card (i.e., your replenishment amount) will be equal to one month's average usage (based on the previous 90 days of use) or $25, whichever amount is greater.</p>
	<p>For accounts that use cash or checks as the primary payment method, the replenishment amount will be equal to one month's average usage (based on the previous 90 days of use) or $40, whichever amount is greater.</p>

      <hr>

<div class="faqs">
<dt id="faq_acctbasics_8006">When is my replenishment threshold and replenishment amount adjusted?</dt>
<dd>
	<p>Your FasTrak account's replenishment threshold and replenishment amount will be reviewed 35 days from the date your account is opened and every 90 days thereafter. It will be adjusted, if necessary, to reflect current use patterns. You will be notified on your statement whenever your replenishment amount has been adjusted, either increased or decreased. Replenishment amounts can vary and timing of replenishment is not always consistent. For this reason we do not recommend the use of ATM check/debit cards.</p>
</dd>
</div>

<div class="faqs">
<dt id="faq_acctbasics_8007">What happens if my FasTrak account has a negative balance?<dt>
<dd>
	<p>An account with a negative balance is considered "invalid". Any transaction recorded on a negative account is a violation of the requirement to pay the established toll. Violations could result in your being liable for costly penalties and fees as specified in the California Vehicle Code Section 40250. Negative accounts will be closed after 90 days and toll tag deposits will be forfeited. To bring your account to a positive balance, you can make an immediate payment online using a credit card. To do so, sign in to your account and select Increase My Balance. Choose how much you want to add and provide your credit card information. You can save the credit card to your account for future use or chose to use it just the one time.</p>
</dd>
</div>

<div class="faqs">
<dt id="faq_acctbasics_8008">Why is providing the Customer Service Center my license plate number(s) important?</dt>
<dd>
	<p>Should your toll tag not read as you drive through the toll plaza, a photo of your license plate will be taken. The toll amount will then be deducted from your account by matching the license plate information in the photo with the license plate information on file with FasTrak. If there is no match, a violation notice or invoice (Golden Gate Bridge only) will be sent to the registered owner of the vehicle in the photo. As such, your vehicle information should be kept current with FasTrak in order to prevent violation notices and invoices (Golden Gate Bridge only) from being sent to you. You will be responsible for tolls charged to your account based on the identification of your license plate number, unless you notify us of changes to your license plate number.</p>

<div class="faqs">
<dt id="faq_acctbasics_8009">How do I change my primary payment method from Credit Card to cash or check?</dt>

<dd>
	<p>Your account will remain active, providing you have some activity on your account during a period of 3 years.

	<p>In order to open an anonymous FasTrak account, you must visit the FasTrak Customer Service Center in person. You can open your account with cash, money order, or cashier's check. A Customer Service Representative will be able to open your account without requiring customer name, address or vehicle information.

	<p>You can replenish your account with cash, money order or cashier's check in person or by mail. Please do not send cash in the mail. Print your toll tag number or account number on the money order or cashier's check and the amount will be added to your prepaid balance.</p>
