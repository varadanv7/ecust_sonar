<dt id="faq_acc_001">Do I own the FasTrak toll tag?</dt>
<dd>
	<p>No. The toll tag is on loan to you by the FasTrak Customer Service Center.</p>
	<p>If a credit card is stored as the primary payment method on your FasTrak account, there is no security deposit for up to the first three (3) toll tags on your account. For each toll tag over three, there is a $20 deposit. If you do not have a credit card stored to your FasTrak account, there is a $20 deposit for each toll tag. All deposits are refunded when the account is closed and the toll tag is returned in good condition to the FasTrak Customer Service Center.</p>

<dt id="faq_acc_004">Can I switch my toll tag from vehicle to vehicle?</dt>
<dd>
	<p>Yes. The toll tag mounted to your windshield can be moved from vehicle to vehicle as long as it is properly mounted at each location, as described in the <a href="../support/mounting.shtml">Mounting Instructions</a>. It is recommended that the vehicle information, including license plate number, make, and model for each vehicle, be listed on your account. However, to avoid potential problems, we recommend that you obtain toll tags for each vehicle.</p>
	<p>The potential problems that can occur when sharing a toll tag between several vehicles include, losing the toll tag, having the toll tag in the wrong car when you need it, or wearing out the Velcro strips much sooner than normal. In addition, your statement will not distinguish which car you were in when crossing the bridge or using the Express Lanes, and for some customers, this is important for tracking their toll transactions. If you want to track your toll transactions by vehicle, you need to obtain separate toll tags for separate vehicles.</p>
	<p>You can request additional toll tags by logging into your account online and clicking on "Vehicles &amp; Tags". You can also download and complete an <a href="../images/toll_tag_request_form.pdf" target="_blank">Additional Toll Tag Request Form</a> and send it to the <a href="../support/csc.shtml">Customer Service Center</a>.</p>

<dt id="faq_acc_005">If I am in an eligible carpool vehicle and travel through a carpool lane with my toll tag, will I be charged on my FasTrak account?</dt>
<dd>
	<p><b>Golden Gate Bridge:</b></p>
	<p>Yes. To be eligible to receive the discounted carpool toll rate of $4.25 at the Golden Gate Bridge, you must have a FasTrak account in good standing and travel through a designated carpool lane. Eligible carpool vehicles include: (1) 2-axle vehicles with 3 or more people; (2) motorcycles, including three-wheeled motorcycles; and (3) buses. Two-seat vehicles and vehicles with rear axle dual tires do not qualify as a carpool on the Golden Gate Bridge. Carpool hours are 5 am to 9 am and 4 pm to 6 pm, weekdays except on specific observed holidays: New Year's Day, Presidents' Day (third Monday in Feb.), Memorial Day (last Monday in May), Independence Day (July 4), Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day.</p>
	<p>If a valid FasTrak tag is not present in the vehicle, the discounted toll rate will not apply, no matter whether or not the other carpool discount requirements are met.</p>
	<p><b>All Other Bridges:</b></p>
	<p>As of July 1, 2010, carpools are charged a discounted toll rate of $2.50. Carpools must use <strong>designated carpool lanes and pay the toll with FasTrak</strong> to qualify for the discounted toll rate. If you drive through a carpool toll lane without a FasTrak toll tag (even if you meet occupancy requirements for the carpool lane), a violation notice will be sent to the vehicle's registered owner. It is a violation of the toll evasion statutes under California Vehicle Code Section 23302 et seq. and Streets and Highways Code Section 30843 to fail to pay the established bridge toll.</p>
	<p><b>Bay Area Express Lanes:</b></p>
	<p>Carpool vehicles with two or more people, motorcycles, transit buses, and solo drivers in eligible hybrids can use the Bay Area Express Lanes for free. If you are in a carpool vehicle and you have a FasTrak toll tag, you will need to remove it from your windshield and place it inside the Mylar bag that was provided to you by FasTrak, so that you are not charged for that particular trip. It is important to make sure that after your carpool trip, you properly re-install your toll tag onto your windshield.</p>

<dt id="faq_acc_007">What happens when I drive through a toll plaza?</dt>
<dd>
	<p>As you drive through a toll plaza, the Driver Feedback Display, located just past the collection booth window, will advise you of your account status as you hear your toll tag beep.</p>
	<ul class="faqCopy">
		<li>If your FasTrak account is valid and has a sufficient balance, it will display "VALID ETC" or "VALID FASTRAK". ("ETC" refers to electronic toll collection.)</li>
		<li>If your FasTrak account has a low balance, it will display "LOW BAL" or "ACCOUNT LOW".</li>
		<li>If your FasTrak account is invalid, for any reason, the display will be blank or it will display "CALL FASTRAK".</li>
	</ul> 
	<p>Note: There are no Driver Feedback Displays in the FasTrak lanes at the Benicia-Martinez Bridge, nor are there any in the Bay Area Express Lanes.</p>
