<dd>
	<p>CHP currently enforces toll evasion and HOV occupancy on HOV lanes and express lanes. In the I-580 express lanes, and planned for other express lanes in the future, toll system cameras will capture images of vehicle license plates. If a valid FasTrak toll tag is not detected, an image of the vehicle license plate will be used to send a violation notice to the vehicle’s registered owner through the mail. The notice will include the toll amount plus a penalty for using the express lane without a valid FasTrak toll tag.</p>

<dt id="faq_enforce_11004">What happens if a FasTrak Flex toll tag is switch to the 2 or 3+ position, but there is only one person in the vehicle?</dt>
<dd>
	<p>CHP enforce HOV occupancy on express lanes. The FasTrak Flex toll tag will show CHP the vehicles that have declared themselves as eligible for toll-free travel by switching the tag to a toll-free setting. When a FasTrak Flex toll tag is set in the 2 or 3+ position, CHP is alerted that a vehicle is using the express lane toll-free and which toll exemption is being declared. CHP will visually confirm that these vehicles qualify for toll-free status; if not, CHP may pull the vehicle over. A carpool citation in excess of $400 may be issued to the driver.</p>
