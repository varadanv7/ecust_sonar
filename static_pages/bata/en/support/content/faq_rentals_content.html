<dt id="faq_rentals_12001">What are Pass24<sup>&reg;</sup>, eToll<sup>&reg;</sup>, TollPass<sup>&reg;</sup>, and PlatePass<sup>&reg;</sup>?</dt>
<dd>
	<p>These are all electronic toll payment systems which enable certain rental car customers to use the FasTrak lanes on the Bay Area toll bridges. They allow you to drive non-stop through the toll plaza in any lane with a FasTrak sign. Upon renting a vehicle from a participating rental car agency, these individual services charge tolls plus a service fee as agreed upon in your rental agreement. Not all rental car agencies participate in these programs.</p>
	<p>Note: You may not use carpool lanes unless you have the required number of occupants.</p>

<dt id="faq_rentals_12002">How do these tolling programs work?</dt>
<dd>
	<p>If you rent a vehicle at one of the participating rental car agencies under the any one of these programs, and you signed up, you simply drive through the FasTrak lane without stopping and your tolls will be collected electronically. The rental agency will also charge their service fees, as agreed upon in your rental agreement.</p>
	<p>Note: You cannot use these programs to pay tolls in the Bay Area Express Lanes. To pay your tolls in the Express Lanes, you must have a FasTrak toll tag in your rental vehicle.</p>

<dt id="faq_rentals_12003">If I have a FasTrak account, can I use my toll tag in a rental car that is under one of these rental car tolling programs?</dt>
<dd>
	<p>Yes. You can use your FasTrak toll tag in a rental car and the program will not be activated. If the toll tag is not mounted properly on the windshield of the rental car, the toll tag may not be read by the electronic toll collections system when you pass through the toll lane. If this occurs, you will need to contact the appropriate program to be charged for the tolls only through the program you signed up for and have any penalties and fees waived.</p>

<dt id="faq_rentals_12004">What if I did not sign up for the Pass24<sup>&reg;</sup>, eToll<sup>&reg;</sup>, TollPass<sup>&reg;</sup>, or PlatePass<sup>&reg;</sup> Program and accidently drove my rental car through a FasTrak lane?</dt>
<dd>
	<p>If you did not sign up for any of these programs upon renting your vehicle, you will be responsible for a toll invoice (Golden Gate Bridge only) or a violation notice which will include the tolls plus penalties and fees. An invoice (Golden Gate Bridge only) or toll violation notice (all other Bay Area toll bridges) will be sent to you to the address on file with the rental car agency. If the Golden Gate Bridge invoice is not paid by the due date, it will escalate to a violation notice. Violation penalties and fees are listed below.</p>
	<p>It is a violation of the toll evasion statutes under California Vehicle Code Section 23302 et seq. and Streets and Highways Code Section 30843 if you fail to pay the established bridge toll. Pursuant to California Vehicle Code Section 40250 et seq., toll evasion violations shall be enforced by the issuance of notices of toll evasion, delinquent toll evasion and the imposition of civil penalties. The following is a schedule of toll evasion penalties:</p>
	<p>First Notice Issued:<br />
	Toll plus $25 penalty</p>
	<p>Second Notice Issued:<br />
	Toll plus $70 ($25 penalty plus $45 late fee). If toll is paid within 15 days, penalty is reduced to $25</p>
