<dd>
	<p>The Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority (VTA) is implementing the Silicon Valley Express Lanes Program to provide congestion relief through effective use of existing lanes. Silicon Valley Express Lanes (sometimes referred to as High Occupancy Toll or "HOT" Lanes) will have no toll booths, and fees will be collected electronically using FasTrak. Tolls for solo drivers will vary based on the level of congestion and will be adjusted to maintain a free flow of service in the Express Lanes. All eligible carpool vehicles will have free access to the Express Lanes.

<dt id="faq_arnd_003">What are the Alameda County Express Lanes?</dt>
<dd>
	<p>As part of a long-term plan to improve traffic flow on Interstates 680 and 580, the Alameda County Congestion Management Agency is converting some existing carpool lanes to Express Lanes – sometimes called High Occupancy Toll (HOT) Lanes. Carpools will continue to use the lanes for free while solo drivers will use the lanes for a fee that will vary depending on the level of congestion in the Express Lanes. The variable fee will make excess capacity available to paying motorists while guaranteeing a reasonable travel time for all users of the lanes.</p>

<dt id="faq_arnd_004">Where is the Alameda County Express Lanes project?</dt>
<dd>
	<p>The I-680 Express Lane project is located on a 14-mile stretch of southbound I-680 between Highway 84 on the north and Highway 237 on the south. Approximately 80% of the project is located in Alameda County, with the remainder in Santa Clara County.<p/>
	<p>The I-580 Express Lanes project is located on a 12-mile stretch of I-580 from just west of the Hacienda Drive Interchange to just east of the Greenville Road Undercrossing in Alameda County. </p>

<dt id="faq_arnd_005">How do the Alameda Express Lanes work?</dt>
<dd>
	<p>The Express Lanes operate as follows:<br />
	<ul class="bodyCopy">
	<li>Solo drivers who want a more reliable trip on southbound I-680 and eastbound I-580 need to obtain and mount a FasTrak toll tag on their windshields. They are charged a toll each time they choose to use the Express Lane. Carpool vehicles with two or more people, motorcycles, transit buses and eligible hybrids can continue to use the lane for free.</li>
	<li>The existing carpool lanes have been converted to Express Lanes with new striping, specific entry and exit points, overhead electronic signs and a FasTrak electronic toll collection system. The new Express Lanes are separated from general-purpose lanes by triple lines, except at entry and exit points.</li>
	<li>The operation is fully electronic. There are no tollbooths or traffic gates, so customers do not need to slow down or stop to provide a toll payment.</li>
	<li>Motorists with a FasTrak toll tag can enter the Express Lanes at designated places. An overhead electronic sign displays the current toll being assessed. Toll costs vary based on real-time traffic levels on the Express Lanes to ensure that traffic in the lanes flows smoothly.</li>
