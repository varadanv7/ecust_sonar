			<p>For most toll lanes dedicated to exclusive use by FasTrak users on all toll bridges in the Bay Area, the speed limit is 25 miles per hour and enforced by the California Highway Patrol. For toll lanes that are shared with FasTrak and cash paying motorists, FasTrak users should proceed with extreme caution, being alert for stopped vehicles and toll collectors. For Bay Area toll bridges with Open Road Tolling lanes (e.g., Benicia-Martinez Bridge), the posted speed limit is 55 miles per hour.</p>

            <p>Yes. To be eligible to receive the discounted carpool toll rate of $4.25 at the Golden Gate Bridge, you must have a FasTrak account in good standing and travel through a designated carpool lane. Eligible carpool vehicles include: (1) 2-axle vehicles with 3 or more people; (2) motorcycles, including three-wheeled motorcycles; and (3) buses. Two-seat vehicles and vehicles with rear axle dual tires do not qualify as a carpool on the Golden Gate Bridge. Carpool hours are 5 am to 9 am and 4 pm to 6 pm, weekdays except on specific observed holidays: New Year's Day, Presidents' Day (third Monday in Feb.), Memorial Day (last Monday in May), Independence Day (July 4), Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day.</p>
            <p>If a valid FasTrak toll tag is not present in the vehicle, the discounted toll rate will not apply, no matter whether or not the other carpool discount requirements are met.</p>
            <p><strong>All Other Toll Bridges</strong></p>
            <p>As of July 1, 2010, carpools are charged a discounted toll rate of $2.50. Carpools must use designated carpool lanes and pay the toll with FasTrak to qualify for the discounted toll rate. If you drive through a carpool toll lane without a FasTrak toll tag (even if you meet occupancy requirements for the carpool lane), a violation notice will be sent to the vehicle's registered owner. It is a violation of the toll evasion statutes under California Vehicle Code Section 23302 et seq. and Streets and Highways Code Section 30843 to fail to pay the established bridge toll.</p>
