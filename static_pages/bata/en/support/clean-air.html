			<p>No. Effective July 1, 2011, the YELLOW Clean Air Stickers issued by the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) have expired. You are no longer able to drive in a High Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) or carpool lane (on the toll bridges or the Express Lanes) unless you meet the minimum passenger requirements for carpools. Drivers caught using an HOV lane, without the required number of passengers, may be cited by law enforcement.</p>

			<p><strong>State-Owned Toll Bridges</strong></p>
            <p>Yes. Qualified single-occupancy clean air vehicles are permitted to use dedicated HOV/carpool lanes in the Bay Area during designated carpool hours, if these vehicles are displaying the distinctive WHITE or GREEN decals issued by the DMV. Vehicles that meet the requirements for the WHITE decals are Inherently Low Emission Vehicles (ILEVs) that are typically certified pure zero emission vehicles (PZEV) (100% battery electric and hydrogen fuel cell) and compressed natural gas (CNG) vehicles. Vehicles that meet the requirements for the GREEN decals generally meet the enhanced Advanced Technology Partial Zero Emission Vehicle (AT PZEV) requirements, which include plug-in hybrid (PHEV) and hydrogen internal combustion engine (hydrogen ICE) vehicles. For more information, <a href="http://www.arb.ca.gov/msprog/carpool/carpool.htm#FAQ" target="_blank">click here</a>.</p>
            <p>The expiration date for the WHITE or GREEN decals is January 1, 2019. As with all other carpool vehicles, single-occupancy clean air vehicles must also pay tolls when driving across the Bay Area toll bridges in an HOV/carpool lane.</p>
            <p><strong>Golden Gate Bridge</strong></p>
            <p>The Golden Gate Bridge does not have dedicated HOV roadway lanes. However, there is a specific lane(s) dedicated for carpool use during carpool hours. Only vehicles that bear a DMV-issued WHITE Clean Air Vehicle decal are eligible for the $4.25 discounted toll rate for as long as California Vehicle Code Sections 5205.5 and 21655.9 remain in effect. The expiration date for the WHITE decals is January 1, 2019.</p>
            <p>Vehicles bearing the GREEN Clean Air Vehicle are NOT eligible for the reduced toll. You are not able to drive in a High Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) or carpool lane unless you meet the minimum passenger requirements for carpools. Drivers caught using an HOV lane, without the required number of passengers, may be cited by law enforcement.</p>
            <p><strong>Express Lanes</strong></p>
            <p>Yes. Qualified single-occupancy clean air vehicles are permitted to use dedicated HOV/carpool lanes in the Bay Area during designated carpool hours, if these vehicles are displaying the distinctive WHITE or GREEN decals issued by the DMV.</p>
            <p><strong>Please Note:</strong> In the I-580 Express Lanes, a FasTrak Flex tag set in the 3+ position is required to travel toll-free.</p>

			<p>Yes. Even if you have the required number of occupants in your clean air vehicle to qualify as a carpool vehicle (i.e., either 2 or 3, depending on the carpool policies of the bridge you are crossing), you must still pay the toll. However, like all other high-occupancy carpool vehicles, you qualify for a discounted carpool toll rate of $2.50 on the state-owned toll bridges and $4.25 on the Golden Gate Bridge.</p>
