<dt id="faq_acc_601">I received a notice that my prepaid balance is low or negative. Will I be charged late fees for my toll activity?</dt>
<dd>
	<p>Fees are not immediately charged to your account when your account has a negative balance. When the system upgrade is completed, we recommend that you make a payment online within ten (10) days to keep your account in good standing and to avoid receiving violation notices.</p>
	<p>Please continue to use FasTrak as you normally would.</p>

<dt id="faq_acc_602">I need to add a vehicle to my account, but can't access my account to do so. What should I do?</dt>
<dd>
	<p>You are able to switch your FasTrak tag between vehicles. But, we recommend that you have all vehicles listed to your account in case the tag is not read properly. After the system upgrade has been completed, remember to add the vehicle to your account and backdate the vehicle's start date to include the dates of any toll crossings that occurred in that vehicle during the closure.</p>
	<p>If for some reason the roadside equipment isn't able to read your tag properly and a violation notice is generated, adding the vehicle to your account and backdating the start date will waive the fees automatically. You will only be liable for the tolls incurred during the backdated time period.</p>

<dd>
	<p>If you have a low account balance, FasTrak will not try to replenish your account with the credit card on file until after the system upgrade has been completed. Please continue to use FasTrak facilities as you normally would and update your credit card information after 8:30am November 4<sup>th</sup> to maintain your account's good standing. For future reference, additional credit cards can be added to your account as backup payment methods.</p>
	<p>Making payments through the postal mail is also possible. You can mail a check to Bay Area FasTrak, PO Box 26926, San Francisco, CA 94126 to increase your prepaid account balance. Please include your account number on the check. Do not send cash.</p>

<dt id="faq_acc_604">I need to report a lost tag.</dt>
<dd>
	<p>You cannot report a lost tag during the system upgrade. You will be able to deactivate a lost tag when the system upgrade is completed and order a replacement tag at that time.</p>
	<p>You may also purchase a new tag at a retail store and start using it right away, but you will need to register it to your account once the system is back online and cover any tolls incurred to keep your account in good standing.</p>

<dt id="faq_acc_605">I need to report a stolen tag.</dt>
<dd>
	<p>If your tag has been stolen, file a police report. Once the system upgrade has been completed, report the tag stolen to have the tag deactivated. Any tolls incurred after the date the tag was stolen, as supported by the police report, will be waived.</p>
