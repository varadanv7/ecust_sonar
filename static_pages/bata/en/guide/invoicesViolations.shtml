Otherwise, the battery in your FasTrak tag may not be working. If you don't hear a beep or see the light blink when the tag is read, you should contact the Customer Service Center. A Customer Service Representative may be able to waive the violation penalty as a first time courtesy.</div>

		<div class="twoColCopyBlock">
		An invoice is for the toll amount only. You received an invoice for crossing the Golden Gate Bridge if a vehicle registered to you passed through the toll collection point, and either:
		<br>
		<ul>
			<li class="lister">You did not pay the toll through a FasTrak account, License Plate account, or One Time Payment 
			<li class="lister">You did not have a FasTrak toll tag or your toll tag <a href="../howitworks/howToMount.shtml"  class="inLineLinkk">was not read properly</a> and the license plate of the vehicle is not registered to a FasTrak account
		</ul>
		If you have been invoiced by mistake, you can resolve it. If you do not have a FasTrak account, consider opening one before you pay an invoice here. It's a convenient way to pay and you'll receive future toll discounts.

		<br><br>
		You'll also experience FasTrak's many conveniences to save time and money. You'll pay all tolls electronically using a toll tag and avoid waiting in line to pay cash tolls. On the Golden Gate Bridge, you'll receive a $1 discount on future tolls. As a carpool, you'll get a discount during commute times on all Bay Area toll bridges. You can use express lanes as a solo driver. You can travel toll-free in the I-580 Express Lanes as a carpool, motorcycle or eligible Clean Air Vehicle (CAV) using a FasTrak Flex toll tag.

		You can pay for prior toll invoices when you open a FasTrak account. Backdate the start date of the vehicle in the account to the date of your earliest toll crossing within the past 30 days. Sign up with FasTrak to get started.

		<div class="orangeTitleCallout">For first-time violation</div>

		If you incurred a violation for the first time, we will waive the violation penalty if you open a FasTrak account within 30 days of the violation. When you set up your account, backdate the start date of the vehicle which incurred the violation to include the date of your unpaid toll crossing. We will deduct the unpaid toll from your account and waive the penalty portion of the amount owed. You will see the violation status change to "Closed" within about a week.
