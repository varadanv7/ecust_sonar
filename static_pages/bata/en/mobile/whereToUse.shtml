			<h4>Carpools</h4>
			
			<p><strong>Buses, Carpools (THREE or more people) and Motorcycles with FasTrak toll tags</strong> receive discounted toll crossing ($4.25) on weekdays (except holidays) from 5 a.m. to 9 a.m. and 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. Eligible vehicles must have a valid FasTrak toll tag and an account in good standing to receive the discounted toll. Vehicles with dual tires are NOT eligible as carpools.</p>
			<p>To receive the FasTrak discount toll during these hours you must have a valid FasTrak toll tag and travel in a designated carpool lane. </p>
			<p>The Golden Gate Bridge carpool policy requires three or more people for two key reasons: to enhance traffic congestion and to remain within the budgetary requirements of GGBHTD. </p>
			<h4>Clean Air Vehicles</h4>
			<p>Clean Air Vehicles registered by the California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) as a Clean Air Vehicle and displaying the official <strong>WHITE</strong> DMV decal (shown below) are allowed the FasTrak discounted carpool toll ($4.25) during carpool hours only, even if there are fewer than three people in the vehicle. That is, single- and double- occupant vehicles displaying the <strong>WHITE</strong> DMV decal qualify for the discounted toll rate during carpool hours provided they adhere to the carpool discount requirements stated above.  </p>
			<p>The 2012 DMV-issued GREEN decal DOES NOT qualify the vehicle for the discounted $4.25 carpool toll rate.</p>
			<p>For official information about qualifying vehicles and DMV registration, call 800-242-4450.</p>
