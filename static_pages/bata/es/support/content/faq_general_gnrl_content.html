<dt id="faq_gen_301">What is FasTrak?</dt>
<dd>
	<p>In the Bay Area, FasTrak is a way to pay for tolls on all toll bridges, express lanes, and parking at the San Francisco International Airport electronically. A valid FasTrak account makes it quick and convenient to pay tolls because you don't need to carry cash. It also saves you time by letting you cross bridge toll plazas nonstop, allows carpools to use the carpool lanes and receive discounted rates on toll bridges, lets solo drivers use the Express Lanes, and gives you the option to bypass the parking pay booth at the airport.</p>
	<p>FasTrak is not a "pay as you go" system. You deposit money into your FasTrak account and each time you use your tag, the toll amount is deducted from your account balance. Maintaining a FasTrak account is free - when you close your account and return your tag, the remaining pre-paid balance will be returned to you.</p>
	<p><strong>Note:</strong> Specific <a href="../images/Vehicles_with_Metal_Oxide_Windshields.pdf" target="_blank">vehicle models</a> may require an externally-mounted toll tag (also referred to as an exterior toll tag). Call the <a href="../support/csc.shtml">Customer Service Center</a> to determine if your vehicle may need an externally-mounted toll tag.</p>

<dt id="faq_gen_302">What is a toll tag (or transponder)?</dt>
<dd>
	<p>A toll tag (or transponder) is a small battery-powered device that transmits a radio signal. The lane equipment reads the tag information and the number of axles on your vehicle. This information is used to deduct the correct toll amount from your account balance. The time, date, and location are collected as well.</p>

<dt id="faq_gen_304">How do I get started with a FasTrak account?</dt>
<dd>
	<p>There are two ways to get started with FasTrak. One way is to sign up for an account, either online or send in an application, and we'll mail you a ready-to-use toll tag. The other way is to pick up a tag at one of our convenient retail locations. Then, activate the toll tag by finishing the account enrollment process <a href="../routers/tagreg.html">online</a> or over the phone with one of our friendly Customer Service representatives. For select retail locations, click <a href="#" onclick="return popitup('../howitworks/retailmap.html');">here</a>.</p>

<dt id="faq_gen_305">Is there a charge to open a FasTrak account?</dt>
<dd>
	<p>There are no fees to open or to maintain a FasTrak account. As toll tags are leased, refundable security deposits do apply. The security deposit is $20 per toll tag. The deposit is refunded to you when you close your account and return the toll tag in good condition. If you maintain a valid credit card on your account, the security deposit for up to three toll tags is waived.</p>
	<p>FasTrak is not a "pay as you go" system. You deposit money into your FasTrak account and each time you use your tag, the toll amount is deducted from your account balance. An initial balance is required upon account opening so that you have a prepaid balance from which tolls can be deducted. To open an account using a valid credit card, an initial prepaid balance of $25 per toll tag is collected. To open an account using cash or a check deposit, an initial prepaid balance of $50 per toll tag plus a $20 per toll tag deposit is collected. The deposit is refunded to you when you close your account and return the toll tag in good condition. Any remaining balance on your account will also be refunded to you upon account closure.</p>

<dt id="faq_gen_306">Where can FasTrak toll tags be used?</dt>

In Southern California, FasTrak can be used on toll roads and express lanes.

<dt id="faq_gen_308">Do I need to use certain lanes at the toll plaza to use my FasTrak toll tag?</dt>
<dd>
	<p>All toll booths on all eight toll bridges in the Bay Area accept FasTrak. But, using the FasTrak-only lanes will save you time as you do not have to wait for any cash toll payers queued ahead of you.</p>

<div class="faqs">
<dt id="faq_gen_309">Which Bay Area toll bridges have FasTrak-only lanes?</dt>
<dd>
	<p>FasTrak-only lanes are not staffed by toll collectors so that FasTrak users are able to drive through the toll plaza without having to stop. </p>
	<p>All of the seven state-owned toll bridges have at least one FasTrak-only lane in operation. At the Golden Gate Bridge, the lanes are all electronic, which means there are no toll collectors. FasTrak can be used in all the lanes at the Golden Gate Bridge without having to stop at the toll plaza.</p>

<dt id="faq_gen_310">How fast can I travel through the FasTrak lane on the toll bridges?</dt>
<dd>
	<p>For most toll lanes dedicated to exclusive use by FasTrak users on all toll bridges in the Bay Area, the speed limit is 25 miles per hour and enforced by the California Highway Patrol. For toll lanes that are shared with FasTrak and cash paying motorists, FasTrak users should proceed with extreme caution, being alert for stopped vehicles and toll collectors. For Bay Area toll bridges with Open Road Tolling lanes (e.g., Benicia-Martinez Bridge), the posted speed limit is 55 miles per hour.</p>

<div class="faqs">
<dt id="faq_gen_312">Can I use FasTrak with my motorcycle?</dt>
<dd>
	<p>Yes. Motorcycles can use FasTrak to pay tolls by mounting their toll tag in a secure location. It is recommended that you use one of the following methods to secure your toll tag: </p>
	<ul class="bodyCopy">
		<li>Place toll tag in your front pocket, as it can be read through the material.</li>
		<li>Place toll tag inside a cycle net (somewhere on top) that drapes over the gas tank.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>We do not advise you to hold the toll tag up while driving through the toll lane as it may not be read accurately. Also, we are not responsible for any lost toll tags due to the toll tag not adhering to the motorcycle windshield. For more information on how to properly mount your toll tag, please visit the <a href="../support/mounting.shtml">Mounting Instructions</a> page.</p>
