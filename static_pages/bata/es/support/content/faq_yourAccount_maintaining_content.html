<dt id="faq_acc_301">How can I track my FasTrak account activity?</dt>
<dd>
	<p>The FasTrak system tracks your toll usage and account balance. A monthly or quarterly statement itemizing your toll payments and account balance will be sent to you through the mail or email. The frequency and delivery method of your statements is determined by you. You may also check your account balance by logging into your account online or by calling the <a href="../support/csc.shtml">Customer Service Center</a>.</p>

<dt id="faq_acc_303">How is the prepaid balance in my account replenished?</dt>
<dd>
	<p>Account replenishment is different depending on the type of replenishment method you chose at the time you opened your account.</p>
	<p>For accounts that use a credit card as the primary payment method, automatic charges will be made to your credit card to replenish your FasTrak account whenever your prepaid toll balance falls below $15 or the minimum threshold.</p>
	<p>For accounts that use cash or checks as the primary payment method, you are responsible for depositing prepaid tolls into your FasTrak account whenever the "Low Bal" or "Account Low" message appears on the Driver Feedback Display located at the toll booth. You must replenish your account whenever your prepaid toll balance falls below $30 or the minimum threshold. </p>
</dd>
</div>
<div class="faqs">
<dt id="faq_acc_304">How is the replenishment amount determined?</dt>
<dd>
	<p>For credit card accounts, the amount charged to your credit card (i.e., your replenishment amount) will be equal to one month's average usage (based on the previous 90 days of use) or $25, whichever amount is greater. For cash/check accounts, the replenishment amount will be equal to one month's average usage (based on the previous 90 days of use) or $40, whichever amount is greater.</p>
</dd>
</div>
<div class="faqs">
<dt id="faq_acc_305">When is my replenishment threshold and replenishment amount adjusted?</dt>
<dd>
	<p>Your FasTrak account's replenishment threshold and replenishment amount will be reviewed 35 days from the date your account is opened and every 90 days thereafter. It will be adjusted, if necessary, to reflect current use patterns. You will be notified on your statement whenever your replenishment amount has been adjusted, either increased or decreased. Replenishment amounts can vary and timing of replenishment is not always consistent. For this reason we do not recommend the use of ATM check/debit cards.</p>

<div class="faqs">
<dt id="faq_acc_306">Is there a deposit required for my toll tag(s)?</dt>
<dd>
	<p>A security deposit may be required when you open your FasTrak account.</p>
	<p>For accounts that use a credit card as the primary payment method, a deposit will NOT be required for the first three (3) toll tags issued to your FasTrak account. If more than three toll tags are issued, you will be charged a deposit of $20 for each additional toll tag.</p>
	<p>For accounts that use cash or checks as the primary payment method, a refundable deposit of $20 is required for each toll tag.</p>
	<p>Note: Should you close your account and return your toll tag in good working condition, the deposit will be refunded to you. Deposits may be forfeited for damaged, lost or stolen toll tags.</p>
</dd>
</div>
<div class="faqs">
<dt id="faq_acc_307">What happens if my FasTrak account has a negative balance?</dt>
<dd>
	<p>An account with a negative balance is considered "invalid". Any transaction recorded on a negative account is a violation of the requirement to pay the established toll. Violations could result in your being liable for costly penalties and fees as specified in the California Vehicle Code Section 40250. Negative accounts will be closed after 90 days and toll tag deposits will be forfeited. To bring your account to a positive balance, you can make an immediate payment online using a credit card. To do so, sign in to your account and select Increase My Balance. Choose how much you want to add and provide your credit card information. You can save the credit card to your account for future use or chose to use it just the one time.</p>

<div class="faqs">
<dt id="faq_acc_308">Will my FasTrak account remain active if I am an infrequent or seasonal user?</dt>
<dd>
	<p>Your account will remain active, providing you have some activity on your account during a period of 3 years. If there is no activity on your account for a period of 3 years or more, you will be notified by mail that your account will be automatically closed and instructions will be provided on how to return your toll tag(s) for proper credit. After 30 days, your account will be closed and any remaining balance will be refunded to you.</p>

<div class="faqs">
<dt id="faq_acc_309">Why is providing the Customer Service Center my license plate number(s) important?</dt>
<dd>
	<p>Should your toll tag not read as you drive through the toll plaza, a photo of your license plate will be taken. The toll amount will then be deducted from your account by matching the license plate information in the photo with the license plate information on file with FasTrak. If there is no match, a violation notice or invoice (Golden Gate Bridge only) will be sent to the registered owner of the vehicle in the photo. As such, your vehicle information should be kept current with FasTrak in order to prevent violation notices and invoices (Golden Gate Bridge only) from being sent to you. You will be responsible for tolls charged to your account based on the identification of your license plate number, unless you notify us of changes to your license plate number.</p>

<div class="faqs">
<dt id="faq_acc_310">What do I do if my FasTrak toll tag is lost, stolen, damaged or defective?</dt>
<dd>
	<p>If the toll tag is lost, stolen or damaged, you will be liable for the deposit amount of $20. If it is lost/stolen and you immediately notify the FasTrak Customer Service Center, you will not be responsible for any unauthorized use of your toll tag after notification. If the toll tag is stolen and documentation is provided (e.g., police report), the deposit may be adjusted. If the toll tag is defective, return it to the FasTrak Customer Service Center and request a replacement at no additional cost.</p>
