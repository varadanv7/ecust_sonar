How can I update the information on my FasTrak account?
</dt><dd>
You can update your account information (e.g., mailing address, day or evening phone numbers, vehicle information, etc.) by one of several ways:<br><br><ul class="faqCopy" id="null"><li>Log into your account online at <a href="http://qa.bayareafastrak.org/vector/account/home/accountLogin.do">My Account and edit information as necessary.</a></li><li>Download an <a target="_blank" href="../images/account_update.pdf">Account Update Form and mail/fax it to the </a><a href="../support/csc.shtml">Customer Service Center.</a></li><li>Contact the <a href="../support/csc.shtml">Customer Service Center by phone.

How is the prepaid balance in my account replenished?
</dt><dd><p>Account replenishment is different depending on the type of replenishment method you chose at the time you opened your account.
<p>For credit card accounts, automatic charges will be made to your credit card to replenish your FasTrak account whenever your prepaid toll balance falls below $15 or the minimum threshold.
<p>For cash/check accounts, you are responsible for depositing prepaid tolls into your FasTrak account whenever the "Low Bal" or "Account Low" message appears on the Driver Feedback Display located at the toll booth. You must replenish your account whenever your prepaid toll balance falls below $30 or the minimum threshold.
</p><dt>What do I do if my FasTrak toll tag is lost, stolen, damaged or defective?</dt><dd>If the toll tag is lost, stolen or damaged, you will be liable for the deposit amount of $20. If it is lost/stolen and you immediately notify the FasTrak Customer Service Center, you will not be responsible for any unauthorized use of your toll tag after notification. If the toll tag is stolen, and documentation is provided (e.g., police report), the deposit may be adjusted. If the toll tag is defective, return it to the FasTrak Customer Service Center and request a replacement.</dd><dt>What happens if my FasTrak account has a negative balance?</dt><dd>An account with a negative balance is considered "invalid". Any transaction recorded on a negative account is a violation of the requirement to pay the established toll. Violations could result in your being liable for costly penalties and fees as specified in the California Vehicle Code Section 40250. Negative accounts will be closed after 90 days and toll tag deposits will be forfeited. To bring your account to a positive balance, you can make an immediate one-time payment online using a credit card. To do so, log into your account and then click on "Payment Info".</dd></p></p></dd></ds>
