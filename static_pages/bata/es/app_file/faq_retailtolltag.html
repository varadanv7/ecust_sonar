If you choose to use your toll tag before registering it, then you must register it within seven (7) business days from the day you first use it. If you do not register it within this time period, the toll tag will become "inactive" and will be in violation of California Vehicle Code 4770 and any other applicable law. To avoid this situation, it is recommended that you register your toll tag immediately after you purchase it. </p></dd></ds><ds editarea="ds3" editareadesc="Prepaid Tolls"><dt>I purchased my toll tag from a retail store.
