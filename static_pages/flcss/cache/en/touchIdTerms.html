            <p class="touch-mainContent">General Terms</p>
            <p class="terms-content">Touch ID allows you to use your fingerprint to login securely instead of entering your username and password. Your username and password will not be stored on this device. By enabling Touch ID, every person with an enrolled fingerprint on this device will have access to your SunPass account. We suggest reviewing the enrolled fingerprints to make sure that each person is authorized to access the personal and financial information available in this app. Fingerprints are only stored on your device and SunPass app does not see or store your fingerprint information during the authentication process. You are responsible for safeguarding your mobile device. The use of Touch ID signifies you acknowledge these terms have been accepted by one or more of the persons who established the subject account with us. You are responsible for all transfers and/or transactions performed with Touch ID and agree not to hold SunPass liable for any errors. If you are not comfortable with these terms we suggest you not enable Touch ID and resort to using your username and password to gain access to your account thru this mobile device.</p>
            <p class="touch-mainContent">Privacy Agreement</p>
            <p class="terms-content">From time to time, we may change this Policy. The effective date of this policy, as indicated above, reflects the last time this Policy was revised. Any changes to this Policy will become effective when we post the revised Policy on our APPs. Your use of the SunPass app following these changes means that you accept the revised Policy.</p>
            <p class="touch-mainContent">Personal Data</p>
            <p class="terms-content">Data security is a top concern not only for enterprises and small business, but for everyday consumers as well. With widespread data breaches exposing everything from customer login credentials to credit card information to personal health records, consumers must be savvy about data security and take steps to protect their own information. Fortunately, there are many ways individuals and families can take extra precautions to ensure their personal data is safe and secure from hackers and malicious criminals. While few security measures can guarantee that no data security breaches will affect you, implementing multiple layers of personal data security protections substantially reduces the likelihood that your data will be compromised. Educating yourself on what to do should your identity be stolen or your personal data exposed will help you take the proper steps to minimize damage after the fact.</p>
