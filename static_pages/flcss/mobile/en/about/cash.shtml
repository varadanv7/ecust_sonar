									Most SunPass customers have one less thing to worry about because they link their Prepaid Account
to a credit card. When a Personal Account reaches a pre-set low balance threshold (minimum/default
is $10.00), it is automatically funded with a pre-set amount determined at the time of enrollment. The replenishment amount is customized periodically to an average that is equivalent to your monthly travel cost.</p>

<p>
All Easy Pay customers automatically become <a href="../about/whereToUseSunPass.shtml?sy=changename"" class="hrefLinksColor">SunPass Plus</a> customers and have the privilege of using their transponders to pay
for airport parking at Orlando, Tampa, Miami, Palm Beach and Ft. Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airports. SunPass Plus is
also accepted at the Hard Rock Stadium parking facility in Miami.
</p>

<p>
The replenishment thresholds for Commercial accounts are also determined during account enrollment according to the
expected usage.
</p>							
	<p>
Easy Pay is designed to take the worry out of maintaining a sufficient account balance. Be sure the credit card or bank account
assigned to your SunPass account is in good standing and we’ll do the rest when you reach your low balance threshold.
</p>	 
	<p>
You may also add funds to your account as listed below. Please note these are not automatic replenishments and it is your
responsibility to monitor the status of your Prepaid Account and ensure sufficient funds are always available to cover all tolls and
other charges.
